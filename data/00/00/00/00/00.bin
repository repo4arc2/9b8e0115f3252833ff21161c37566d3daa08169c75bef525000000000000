《旺达幻视》前情提要
Previously on WandaVision...

19
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:05,320
哈里医生  我妈妈在哪
Dr. Harley, where's my mom?

20
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:07,430
玛利亚三年前去世了
Maria died three years ago.

21
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,450
在你消失两年后
Two years after you disappeared.

22
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:10,570
莫妮卡·兰博上尉
Captain Monica Rambeau.

23
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:12,300
泰勒·海沃德局长
Director Tyler Hayward.

24
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,410
项目跟有你在时
The program hasn't been the same

25
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:14,840
可大不一样了  兰博
since you've been up there, Rambeau.

{\an8}西景

27
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:17,820
联调局因为一起新泽西州的失踪人口案非常慌张
The FBI is in a tizzy up in Jersey...

28
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,240
这不是什么失踪人口案
This isn't a missing person's case,

29
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,310
兰博上尉  是一个失踪的小镇
Captain Rambeau, it's a missing town.

30
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,140
{\an8}欢迎来到西景
家园由你创造

31
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,600
好像有某种能量力场
Some sort of energy field.

32
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,460
我的设备探测到了极高的宇宙微波背景辐射水平
My equipment registered an extremely high level of CMBR.

33
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,730
缠绕着一个广播频率
Entwined was a broadcast frequency.

34
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:32,210
瞧瞧  有声音有画面
Voila, sound and picture.

35
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,050
是你擅闯了这里
You are trespassing here.

36
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,550
我要你离开这里
And I want you to leave.

37
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,520
杰拉丁在哪
Where's Geraldine?

38
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,470
她走了  她不属于这里
She's gone. She didn't belong here.

39
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:48,810
都是旺达做的
It's all Wanda.

40
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,340
好汤米啊  你不想睡觉吗
Sweet, sweet Tommy, don't you wanna sleep?

41
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,700
妈妈想睡觉
Mommy wants to sleep.

42
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,570
如果你肯睡觉  我保证
If you go to sleep,

43
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,910
你就是双胞胎里我更喜欢的那个
I promise you will be my favorite twin.

44
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,530
好了  亲爱的
Oh, come on now, darling.

45
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:48,920
你知道我对他们的爱是一样的
You know we love them both equally.

46
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,600
别跟他说啊
Well, don't tell him that.

47
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,780
比利也不睡吗
No luck with Billy?

48
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,260
我试过给他读书  不知为何
Tried reading to him, but for some reason,

49
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,370
查尔斯·达尔文的《人类的起源》让他哭得更响了
Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man made him cry even harder.

50
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,520
想跳舞吗  亲爱的
Care to dance, darling?

51
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,450
我们简直像是在约会
It's almost like we're on a date.

52
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:08,210
小点声  伙计们  我要有艳福了
Keep it down, lads, I was about to get my leg over.

53
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:11,100
小幻
Vis?

54
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,030
你可以去拿他们的奶嘴吗
Would you mind grabbing their binkies?

55
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,370
当然  我看两个都需要奶嘴
'Course not. Binkies all round, I think.

56
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,780
我知道家长不该耍赖
Now, I know parents aren't supposed to take shortcuts,

57
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,990
但我觉得眼下的情况是迫不得已了  是吧
but I think this situation calls for one, don't you?

58
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,050
好吧  睡吧  宝贝们
So, go to sleep, my babies.

59
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,460
睡吧
And go to sleep.

60
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,150
这可不好玩
Well, I don't think it's very funny.

61
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:45,070
你们怎么不肯听我话
Why won't you do what I want?

62
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,830
你说什么  亲爱的
What's that, dear?

63
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:51,190
那个才不能插那里呢
That is not where those go!

64
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,750
消除噪音不是它们的主要功能吗
Noise cancelation is not their primary function?

65
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,710
我觉得成...
Look, I think it's...

66
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,260
小幻
Vis?

67
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,400
我们做错了什么
What are we doing wrong?

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,120
别担心  亲爱的  我们会解决的
Oh, don't worry, dear. We'll figure it out.

69
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:13,700
或许我们都需要更多时间来熟悉彼此
Perhaps we all need more time to get to know one another.

70
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:16,470
或许吧  或许我们是需要帮助
Maybe. Or maybe we just need some help.

71
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,110
好啊  孩子们
Hiya, kids!

72
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,960
艾格妮丝
Oh, Agnes!

73
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,810
艾格妮丝  我刚刚正在用我的脸拍这个靠垫
Agnes, I was just fluffing this pillow. With my face.

74
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,200
我正准备去做爵士健美操
Oh, I was just on my way to Jazzercise

75
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,090
可我听说你新生的小可爱
when I heard your new little bundles of joy

76
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,820
不肯睡觉
were on a sleep strike.

77
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:33,890
-谁告诉你的  -我的耳朵
- Who told you that? - Uh, my ears.

78
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:38,190
反正  艾格妮丝阿姨来了
Anyway, Auntie Agnes is here

79
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,140
我知道些诀窍
and I've got a couple of tricks up my sleeve.

80
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,500
艾格妮丝  你真救我命了
Agnes, you're a lifesaver.

81
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,720
那好吧  但小心他们的肚脐
Very well. But be careful of their belly buttons

82
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:46,940
记得托住他们的头
and remember to support their heads,

83
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,490
你上次洗手是什么时候了
and when was the last time you washed...

84
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:49,810
其实  还是...
Actually, you know what? It would be...

85
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:51,290
我们还是别了
Just... Maybe we better not.

86
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,150
你要我再来一次吗
Do you want me to take that again?

87
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,010
什么
I'm sorry?

88
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:11,090
你要我抱宝宝的
You want me to hold the babies.

89
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,090
我们要从头再来一遍吗
Should we just take it from the top?

90
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,360
什么
What?

91
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:22,290
别傻了
Oh, don't be silly.

92
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:26,070
幻视  让艾格妮丝试试吧
Vision, let's... Let's let Agnes give it a try.

93
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,040
可爱宝宝  看看这钢铁般的屁股
Fussy babies, meet buns of steel.

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,170
你们敢不敢一直不睡
We dare you to stay awake.

95
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,670
旺达
Wanda.

96
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,150
刚刚怎么回事
What was that about?

97
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,550
什么怎么回事
What was what?

98
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,810
"什么怎么回事"  刚刚艾格妮丝那一出
"What was what?" That, that with Agnes just now.

99
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,560
我觉得她就是有一下犯糊涂了
Well, I think she just got confused for a moment.

100
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,850
她现在好像没事了
She seems fine now.

101
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,750
但她说的话  她看你的眼神
But what she said, the way she looked at you...

102
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,890
她怎么看我了
How did she look at me?

103
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,200
我不知...
Well, I didn't...

104
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,010
薰衣草  据说有安抚的效力
Lavender. It's supposed to have a calming effect.

105
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,640
拉夫每晚都往我身上喷
Ralph sprays it on me every night.

106
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,650
但本母老虎没人可以驯服  是吧
But there's no taming this tiger. What?

107
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,270
好奇怪啊
It's so strange.

108
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:16,380
这不公平
That's not fair.

109
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:19,660
艾格妮丝性欲异常旺盛又不能怪她
It's not Agnes's fault that she has an unusually high libido.

110
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,320
旺达
Wanda?

111
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,980
你真没看到我看到的吗
Did you really not see what I saw?

112
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,570
别介意我  我就是在找你的烈酒
Don't mind me. I'm just looking for your dark liquor.

113
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,720
-什么  -不是给我
- What? - Not for me.

114
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,140
给双胞胎的  你们当我是什么样的保姆啊
For the twins. What kind of babysitter do you think I am?

115
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,590
我去那里看看
I'm just gonna go and check in there.

116
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,130
幻视  儿子们好几天没睡觉了
Vision, the boys haven't slept in days.

117
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,350
你和我都需要休息一下了
You and I both need a break

118
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:43,890
艾格妮丝只是想做个好邻居罢了
and Agnes is just being neighborly, that's all.

119
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,290
你听到了吗
Do you hear that?

120
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,280
听到什么
Hear what?

121
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,900
什么声音都没有
Absolutely nothing.

122
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,720
他们可算睡了
They finally fell asleep.

123
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,620
婴儿床空了
They're empty.

124
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,330
双胞胎哪去了
Then where are the twins?

125
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:59,590
-妈妈  -爸爸
- Mommy? - Daddy?

126
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,610
孩子啊
Kids.

127
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,780
你管不住他们
You can't control 'em.

128
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:10,490
不管你多努力
No matter how hard you try.

129
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,950
你们好啊
Well, hi!

130
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:25,410
你还好吗  宝贝
How are you doing, baby?

131
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,210
-嗯  -嗯
- Yeah. - Yeah.

132

00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:30,650
*我们会感到前路迷茫*
*We won't know which way to go*

149
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:31,670
{\an8}和比利

150
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,730
*但我们会继续高飞*
*But we'll take it higher*

151
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,010
*你是我想要的一切*
*You're all I desire*

152
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:36,750
*当日子艰难*
*When the going gets tough*

153
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,740
*当关键时刻到来*
*When push comes to shove*

154
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:41,410
*我们边走边看*
*We're making it up*

155
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,770
*因为我们相爱*
*'Cause we got love*

156
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,190
*我们相爱*
*We got love*

157
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,000
*我们相爱*
*We got love*

158
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,720
*我们相爱*
*We got love*

159
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,710
*亲爱的  我们有*
*Baby, we got...*

160
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,840
*旺达幻视*
*WandaVision*

161
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,770
{\an8}旺达幻视
第一季  第五集

162
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,420
你记得的第一件事是什么
What's the first thing you do remember?

163
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,910
痛苦
Pain.

164
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:11,470
然后  脑子里响起旺达的声音
And then, Wanda's voice in my head.

165
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,370
你抵抗了吗
Did you try to resist?

166
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,960
有种感觉抑制着我
There was this feeling keeping me down.

167
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,420
一种无助感
This hopeless feeling.

168
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,040
像淹溺
Like drowning.

169
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,250
{\an8}"光子"玛利亚·兰博

170
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,090
是悲痛
It was grief.

171
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:27,680
你可以坐起来了
You can sit up now.

172
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,700
好啊
Great.

173
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:33,040
我没事了吗
So am I cleared?

174
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,290
等我先看看
Once I get a look at these.

175
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:37,660
我的制服呢
Where's my uniform?

176
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:38,800
在分析
In analysis.

177
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,550
你回来太好了  上尉
Mighty glad to have you back, Captain.

178
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:44,540
你感觉怎么样
How you feeling?

179
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,040
像我自己
Like myself.

180
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:47,680
那谢天谢地了
Well, thank heavens for that.

181
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,150
最新情况怎么样了
Uh, what's the latest?

182
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,200
十分钟后有简报  最好穿裤子
There's a briefing in ten. Pants are encouraged.

183
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,750
-谢谢  -这是达西·刘易斯博士
- Thank you. - This is Dr. Darcy Lewis.

184
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,780
是她发现了放送信号
She's the one who discovered the broadcast.

185
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:00,890
-我是  -莫妮卡  我知道  我是大粉丝
- I'm... - Monica. I know. Um, big fan.

186
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:02,690
我们需要再拍一次
We're gonna need to take these again.

187
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,240
机器不太对劲
There's something wrong with the machine.

188
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,350
那是空白的
Those are blank.

189
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:06,380
我说了
Like I said.

190
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,750
她的实验室分析呢
Well, what about her labs?

191
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,330
我得再抽一次血
I need another blood draw.

192
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,660
不不  我们到此为止吧
No, no, no. We're done here.

193
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,580
她就会这样  简报见
She does that. See you at the briefing.

194
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:19,950
早
Morning.

195
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,700
我们现在对危机有清晰评估了
We are now assessing a clear picture of this crisis.

196
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,630
多亏兰博上尉
And thanks to Captain Rambeau,

197
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:27,380
我们现在有西景异常现象
we now have first-person intel

198
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,920
内部的第一手情报
from inside the Westview Anomaly.

199
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,710
我们最初猜测旺达·马克西莫夫
Our initial theory had Wanda Maximoff

200
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,210
也是受害者之一
as one of many victims.

201
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:37,490
我们现在知道她是主要施害者
We now know she is the principal victimizer.

202
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,350
吉米
Jimmy.

203
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,690
让大家简单了解一下我们的目标
Quick history on our subject.

204
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,190
1989年出生于索科威亚  父母是艾莉娜和奥列格
Born in Sokovia in 1989 to Irina and Oleg Maximoff,

205
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:47,180
{\an8}索科威亚遭到袭击

206
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,790
双双死于空袭
both killed during an air raid

207
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,810
当时马克西莫夫和她的双胞胎哥哥皮特当时十岁
when Maximoff and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.

208
00:09:50,810 --> 00:09:53,360
这对双胞胎兄妹便成了激进分子
The twins were subsequently radicalized,

209
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,600
主动加入了九头蛇
volunteering at HYDRA.

210
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,930
这么形容此后的一系列事件有些轻描淡写  不过没错
It's an oversimplification of events, but, yes.

211
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:01,490
在用意识宝石进行不明实验后
After unspecified experimentation with the Mind Stone,

212
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:05,430
马克西莫夫获得了隔空取物和心灵操控的能力
Maximoff gained telekinetic and telepathic abilities.

213
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,980
倒回去  吉米  马克西莫夫有假名吗
Back up, Jimmy. Does Maximoff have an alias?

214
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,730
-没有  长官  -没有什么奇怪的绰号吗
- No, sir. - No funny nickname?

215
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,570
一个都没有
Not a one.

216
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,240
早期记录显示她曾用她的超能力对抗复仇者们
And earliest tracking had her using her powers against the Avengers.

217
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,190
对吗
Is that correct?

218
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:20,760
后来她获取了他们的信任  也成为了他们中一员
Right before she earned their trust and became one herself.

219
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,540
拉各斯  德国  我们都知道后来的结局
Lagos and Germany, we all know how that turned out.

220
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,790
{\an8}旺达·马克西莫夫  在逃恐怖分子

221
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,420
谢谢你  吉米
Thanks, Jimmy.

222
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:30,570
我们现在了解情况了
Now that we have the lay of the land,

223
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:31,980
该讨论战术了
let's talk about strategy.

224
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,160
-政策要求...  -我尽量不说人坏话
- It is the policy... - I try not to speak ill of people...

225
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,950
那我来说  海沃德就是个...
Then allow me. Hayward's a...

226
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:38,100
恐怖分子
...terrorists.

227
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,270
旺达不是恐怖分子
Wanda's not a terrorist.

228
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,370
根据你的描述  你称遭到
By your own account, you described the experience

229
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:45,590
她的精神控制是
of being under her mind-control as

230
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:49,110
"折磨  可怕  受侵犯的"
"Excruciating, terrifying, a violation."

231
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:52,550
旺达  你好吗
Wanda, what's up?

232
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,270
现在我是大公司白领了
And now that I've gone all corporate...

233
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:59,630
我的意思是  我认为她没有政治诉求
My point is, I don't believe she has a political agenda

234
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,850
以及造成毁灭的倾向
or any inclination toward destruction.

235
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,930
莫妮卡  她把你炸出了半个新泽西
Monica, she blasted you halfway across New Jersey.

236
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,100
我还活着  因为她选择护住了我
And I survived because she chose to protect me.

237
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,690
她劫持了好几千人
She's holding thousands of people hostage.

238
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:10,310
如果她没有主动隔绝
And it could have been thousands more

239
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:12,250
这个人数可不止这么点
if she hadn't put up her own quarantine.

240
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,800
听着  我不认为
Listen, I don't believe

241
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,280
这是有预谋的侵犯行为
this is a premeditated act of aggression.

242
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,090
是吗
You don't?

243
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,650
放出画面
Bring up the visual.

244
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,340
今天早上  我获得了许可
This morning, I received authorization to share

245
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,020
分享这段天剑局总部的
this highly-sensitive material

246
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,470
机密视频资料
from S.W.O.R.D. Headquarters.

247
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:30,190
这个地方原本
Until very recently, it was

248
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:33,190
是存放幻视尸体的机密地点
the top-secret location of the Vision's corpse.

249
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,490
-这是什么时候的事  -九天前
- When was this? - Nine days ago.

250
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,910
马克西莫夫闯进我们的基地  偷走了幻视的尸体
Maximoff stormed our facility, stole the Vision's body,

251
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,740
把他复活了
and resurrected him.

252
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,510
但这直接违反了
But that's in direct violation

253
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,100
《索科威亚协议》36B节
of Section 36 B of the Sokovia Accords.

254
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,000
以及幻视自身的意愿
And the Vision's own living will.

255
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,480
他不想成为任何人的武器
He didn't want to be anybody's weapon.

256
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,160
马克西莫夫在悲痛中  无视了他的意愿
Maximoff, in her grief, disregarded his wishes.

257
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,520
好了  到此为止吧
All right, that's it for now.

258
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:12,160
大家先解决手上的问题  解散
Let's work the problem, people. Dismissed.

259
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,870
但是她怎么做到的
But how did she even do it?

260
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,660
在没有意识宝石的情况下让他复活吗
Bring him back without the Mind Stone?

261
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:19,880
谁知道呢
Who knows?

262
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,710
但是她在让这世界上唯一的合成人
But she has the world's only vibranium synthezoid,

263
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:25,280
跟她演《郊区版老爸最知道》
playing Father-Knows-Best-In-Suburbia.

264
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,530
等他知道真相后会怎么样
What happens when he learns the truth?

265
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:33,310
{\an8}旺达幻视

266
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:38,330
我觉得他不喜欢水
I don't think he likes the water.

267
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:39,670
但我们得把他洗干净
But we have to get him clean,

268
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,070
这样妈妈才会让我们留着它
so Mommy will let us keep him.

269
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:43,870
-汤米  比利  -不好  妈妈来了
- Tommy, Billy! - Oh, no! Mommy's coming!

270
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,320
我一点都不想念你们的哭声
You know, I don't miss the crying,

271
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,060
但是上帝啊  你们非得学会走路吗
but jeez Louise, did you have to learn to walk?

272
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,100
你们俩从来不会乖乖待着
You two never stay put.

273
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,200
除非你们是故意
Unless you're innocently

274
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,140
在厨房的水槽前面砌人墙
forming a human wall in front of the kitchen sink.

275
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,010
上帝保佑你
Bless you.

276
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:02,940
谢谢
Thank you.

277
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,630
告诉我  哪一只小狗叫了
Now tell me which one of you just barked?

278
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,390
散开
Scoot.

279
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,650
天
Oh, boy.

280
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,700
等等  这只犬类在我的水槽里干什么
Waiter, what's this canine doing in my kitchen sink?

281
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,040
狗刨吗
The doggy paddle?

282
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,830
我们能留着它吗  妈妈
Can we keep him, Mommy?

283
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:23,550
它的主人肯定很想念它
Well, I'm sure his owners miss him very much.

284
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,250
来吧
Come on.

285
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,790
还真的没有项圈
Huh. There really is no collar.

286
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:29,420
我们能留着它吗
Can we keep him?

287
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:33,780
它刚刚在门外孤独地哭
He was outside. Crying, alone.

288
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,390
孩子们
Now, boys,

289
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,960
养一个活物需要负很大的责任
taking care of a living thing is a big responsibility.

290
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,360
狗狗需要食物  训练  锻炼
Dogs need food, exercise, training,

291
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:46,230
挠肚子  还有抱抱
belly rubs, and cuddles.

292
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,910
还在亲亲它的耳朵间
And kisses between his little ears.

293
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,810
早上好  老婆  早上还  孩子们
Morning, wife. Morning, boys.

294
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:54,330
早上好  湿哒哒的陌生动物
Good morning, unfamiliar wet animal.

295
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:55,190
它是谁啊
Who's this?

296
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,760
我们其实也不确定
We're not quite sure, actually.

297
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,020
怎么穿得怎么正式  亲爱的
Why so formal, honey?

298
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,500
其实只是未雨绸缪
Oh, it's just a precaution really.

299
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,100
我预感到可能有人会突然来造访
I had a hunch someone might pop over.

300
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,730
孩子们
Hi, kiddos.

301
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,150
还带来了我们正需要的东西
With exactly the item we require.

302
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:14,160
我从厨房窗户发现有人需要新的狗窝
My kitchen window told me someone got a new pooch.

303
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,610
给它取名字了吗
Did you name him yet?

304
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,820
叫嗅嗅怎么样
How about Sniffy?

305
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,060
还是叫火花吧
How about Sparky?

306
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:27,110
那就正式叫这个名字吧
Well, should we make it official?

307
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,270
旺达
Wanda.

308
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:34,520
-艾格妮丝就站在这里呢  -她没有发现
- Agnes was right there! - She didn't notice.

309
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,080
她都没注意到
She didn't even notice

310
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,480
孩子们从婴儿突然变成了五岁小孩
when the boys went from babies to five-year-olds.

311
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,940
我们之前说好的可不是这样
That's not what we agreed upon.

312
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,210
你根本没有费心隐藏你的超能力
You made no effort to conceal your abilities.

313
00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:43,210
我不想再躲躲藏藏了  小幻
Well, I'm tired of hiding, Vis.

314
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,540
也许你也不需要这样了
And maybe you don't have to either.

315
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,690
旺达  我们以前总是会达成一致的看法
Wanda, we are usually so much of the same mind.

316
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,770
但现在...
But right now...

317
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,100
你有什么瞒着我的
What aren't you telling me?

318
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:00,640
那我们可以养火花了吗  爸爸
So, is Sparky our dog, Daddy?

319
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:02,140
什么
What?

320
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,190
孩子们  我和你们的父亲觉得你们
Boys, your father and I don't think you're ready

321
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,840
还没有做好照顾一个小动物的准备  至少要...
to properly care for an animal until you're at least...

322
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,820
-十岁  -十岁
- Ten. - Ten.

323
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,760
十岁
Ten years old.

324
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,440
-等等  等一下  -等等  不不不
- Wait, now, hang on there a minute... - Wait, no, no, no.

325
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,590
-你们两个小鬼头  -不不不
- ...you young whippersnappers. - No, no, no!

326
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,950
希望这只狗还是原来的大小
Let's just hope this dog stays the same size.

327
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,590
好吧  我有办法了
Okay. Okay, I've got it.

328
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,250
我需要一个一万磅的放射性尘埃掩体
What I need is a 10,000-pound fallout shelter

329
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:49,410
用铅吸收光子  镉吸收中子
comprised of lead for photons, cadmium for neutrons,

330
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,920
用钽吸收震荡波  放在车上
tantalum for seismic blasts, on wheels.

331
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,000
然后我就能安全地
And then, I would be able to

332
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,780
重新进入西景镇  对吗
safely re-enter Westview. Right?

333
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,850
理论上来说  是的
Yes. Theoretically.

334
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,700
理论上就足够了
I can work with theoretically.

335
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,630
我错过了什么
What'd I miss?

336
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,500
那对双胞胎长到十岁了
The twins aged up to ten.

337
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,900
上帝啊  以这个速度
Holy Christmas. At this rate,

338
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,840
他们晚餐时就该变成空巢老人了
they'll be empty nesters by dinner time.

339
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,820
我认识一个航空工程师
I know an aerospace engineer

340
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,560
能完成这个挑战
who'd be up for this challenge.

341
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,630
但是我不能保证那个六边域
But I can't guarantee the Hex

342
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,120
不会在你进去的时候把你记忆清除了
won't just mind-wipe you as you go in.

343
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,380
等等  六边域是什么
Wait. What's a Hex?

344
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,600
是我给这个异常点起的代号
Oh, um, it's what I'm calling the anomaly

345
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,690
因为是六边形的嘛
because of its hexagonal shape.

346
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,840
大家都开始这么叫了
It's starting to catch on.

347
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,090
你真的想回去吗
You really wanna go back in there?

348
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,180
她可是让你吃了那么多苦头呢
After everything she's put you through?

349
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,190
是的  我要回去
Yeah. Yes, I do.

350
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,490
我们能确认这两个少年的身份吗
Have we identified these minors yet?

351
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,610
还是应该说是新生儿
Or the newborns?

352
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,310
旺达的双胞胎是她的孩子
Oh, Wanda's twins are hers.

353
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,350
在电视上看起来可能都很假
Everything might look fake in the TV,

354
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,240
但是那里面的一切都是真实的
but everything in there is real.

355
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,530
但是旺达会操控人们的认知
But Wanda manipulates people's perceptions,

356
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,640
让人产生幻觉
makes them hallucinate.

357
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
是的  这是她的全部手段
Yeah, that's her whole bag.

358
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,960
如果这些布景道具服装都是实物
If all the sets and props and wardrobe were solid matter,

359
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:58,330
那就说明她耗损了很多力量
that would mean she's wielding an insane amount of power.

360
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:00,880
比她以往的力量要强得多
Far exceeding anything she's displayed in the past.

361
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,720
要不是灭霸搞偷袭
Uh, she could have taken out

362
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,560
她甚至是能独自干掉他的
Thanos on her own if he hadn't initiated a blitz.

363
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,550
毕竟当时都没人能和他相当
I mean, nobody else came close.

364
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:09,000
惊奇队长就可以
Well, I'd argue that Captain Marvel came close.

365
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:12,420
她的力量也来自无限宝石  对吗
Her powers came from an Infinity Stone, too, right?

366
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,300
我们说的可不是她
We are not talking about her.

367
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,150
我们说的是旺达
We are talking about Wanda.

368
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:20,180
达西
Darcy?

369
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:25,060
你之前说道具  布景  还有...
What was that you were saying about props and sets and...

370
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,070
服装
Wardrobe?

371
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:30,630
实验室在哪
Where's the lab?

372
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,170
我们要找什么
What are we looking for?

373
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:42,470
那个
That.

374
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,090
天啊
Oh, man,

375
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,770
我们是被精神控制了才会看到那个吗
are we being mind-controlled to see that right now?

376
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,400
哎呀呀
Jeepers creepers!

377
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:53,610
不  它们都是真实的
Ooh, no. They're real, all right.

378
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,920
借我用下
Can I borrow this?

379
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,180
你进去的时候穿了防弹衣  是不是
You had a bulletproof vest on when you went inside, didn't you?

380
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,630
这条裤子87%的成分是凯夫拉尔纤维
Those pants are 87% Kevlar.

381
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:19,940
这不是幻觉  旺达在重写现实
It's not an illusion. Wanda is rewriting reality.

382
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:20,800
永久性的吗
Permanently?

383
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,250
如果她能改变进入六边域的东西...
If she can change things as they go into the Hex...

384
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,850
你也叫它六边域了
Ah, you called it the Hex.

385
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:31,830
那我们派无需改变的东西进去会怎样
What happens if we send something in that requires no change?

386
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,520
{\an8}计算服务公司

387
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:44,730
你是说
So you're telling me

388
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,000
这机器是打字机  名片整理盒和日历三合一
this is a typewriter, a Rolodex, and a calendar all in one?

389
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,910
它还有什么本事  帮我找个老婆吗
What else can it do? Find me a wife?

390
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,210
最终它可以的
Eventually, yes.

391
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:54,060
看你用计算机工作真是让我吃惊  幻视
It's a hell of a thing watching you work these computers, Vision.

392
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:56,020
就好像你会说它们的语言
It's like you speak their language.

393
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,420
怎么样  诺曼
What do you think, Norm?

394
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,900
我们要不要在网上冲浪
Should we surf the Internet?

395
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,350
那敢情好啊  兄弟
Cowabunga, dude.

396
00:19:08,030 --> 00:19:09,140
{\an8}一封新电子邮件

397
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,110
看啊  我们这就收到电子邮件了
Hey, look, we got electronic mail already.

398
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,590
它叫电邮  诺曼  你在找什么
It's called an e-mail, Norm. What are you looking for?

399
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,700
拆信刀
Letter opener.

400
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,580
用不着那个  我们已经在最前沿了[割开信封边缘]Ah, we don't need that. We're already cutting edge.

401
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,700

说啊  朋友  我们要怎么回信
Well, come on, pal. What are we gonna write back?

407
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,220
你是办公室里最幽默的那个
You're the office funny guy.

408
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:47,590
我开玩笑的
It's a joke.

409
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,820
你没发现吗
Can't you tell?

410
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,850
全都不是真的
None of it is real.

411
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,690
求你帮帮我
Please. Please help me.

今天几号  过了多久
What day is it? How long has it been?

413
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:07,060
我的手机呢  我得给我姐打电话
Where's my phone? I have to call my sister.

414
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,120
-诺曼  -她在照顾我爸爸  他病了
- Norm. - She's taking care of our dad, he's sick.

415
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,320
-我的手机呢  -冷静  诺曼
- Where is my phone? - Calm yourself, Norm.

416
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,090
我不明白你想说什么
I can't understand what you're trying to tell me.

-你得阻止她  -阻止谁
- You have to stop her. - Stop who?

418
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,970
她在我脑中
She's in my head.

419
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:18,560
这都不是我自愿的
None of it is my own.

让她停下
Just make her stop...

423
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,280
跟我说说
Now tell me this.

424
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:32,890
我要寄电邮的话  邮票往哪贴
If I send an e-mail, where would I put the stamp?

425
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,580
科技真有意思
Technology.

426
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:44,560
坐  火花  坐  乖狗狗
Sit, Sparky, sit. Good dog.

427
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,900
叫一叫
Speak.

428
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,090
漂亮  火花
Nice, Sparky.

429
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,520
转个圈
Now spin.

430
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,420
真乖
Good boy!

431
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,440
太棒了  比利
Bravo, Billy!

432
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,920
你也不错嘛  火花
You weren't so bad either, Sparky.

433
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,450
太棒了
That was radical.

434
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,230
爸爸在哪  我们得让爸爸瞧瞧
Where's Dad? We gotta go show Dad!

435
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,790
他...上班去了
Oh, he's... He's at work.

436
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,770
可是今天周六
It's Saturday.

437
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,320
不  今天周一
No, it's not. It's Monday.

438
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,140
今天早上还是周六的
This morning was Saturday.

439
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,010
公司突然出了点事
There was an emergency at the office

440
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,600
你爸爸不得不去
and your father had to go in.

441
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:14,780
就这样
End of story.

442
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:21,860
他只是...他需要分分心
Look, he just... He needed a distraction.

443
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,550
什么让他烦心了
From what?

444
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,180
我们吗
From us?

445
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:29,900
不  怎么会呢  才没有
No! No way! No!

446
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:36,600
有时你爸爸和我看法不一致
Sometimes your dad and I aren't on the same page,

447
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:40,590
但那只是暂时的
but that's just temporary.

448
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,540
就像你俩  可能会因为玩具打架
Like the two of you, you might fight over toys,

449
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,950
但他永远是你的兄弟
but he's always going to be your brother.

450
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:48,570
他也永远会是你兄弟
And he is always going to be yours.

451
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:51,350
因为一家人永远在一起
Because family is forever.

452
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,390
你有兄弟吗  妈妈
Do you have a brother, Mom?

453
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,170
有
I do.

454
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,570
他在离这里很远的地方
Yeah. He's far away from here.

455
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:04,690
有时那让我很难过
And that makes me sad sometimes.

456
00:22:07,990 --> 00:22:09,590
火花  怎么了
Hey, Sparky, what's up, boy?

457
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,670
有什么吓着它了
Something's scaring him.

458
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,930
待在这里
Stay here.

459
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,400
火花
Sparky!

460
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:36,580
我知道这是八零年代的技术了
I know this is tech from the '80s,

461
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,280
但画面能不能调清晰些
but can we sharpen the visuals?

462
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,060
我在处理
Working on it.

463
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:44,140
确定马克西莫夫的位置了
Maximoff located.

464
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:45,240
做得好
Well done.

465
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,940
在节目上看不见无人机
We can't see the drone on the broadcast.

466
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:48,670
旺达没让它入镜
Wanda's framing it out of the shot.

467
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,370
就像那些跳接剪辑一样
Just like all the jump cuts.

468
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,100
旺达决定什么能出现在她节目里  什么不能
Wanda decides what makes it onto her show and what doesn't.

469
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:55,990
到了  该你上场
And here we go. You're up.

470
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,290
旺达  我是莫妮卡·兰博上尉
Wanda, this is Captain Monica Rambeau.

471
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,400
你能听见吗
Can you hear me?

472
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,760
我只想和你谈谈  仅此而已
I just want to talk. That's it.

473
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,900
不对
No joy.

474
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:15,540
等等  我的控制杆失灵了  重连调度台
Wait, my controls aren't working. Reconnect patch.

475
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,170
无视  开火
Disregard. Take the shot.

476
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,480
什么  不  无人机上没武器
What? No. The drone isn't armed.

477
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,610
开火
Take the shot.

478
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:27,050
你做了什么
What did you do?

479
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,620
有缺口  长官
There's a breach, sir.

480
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,330
这是你们的吗
Is this yours?

481
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,610
导弹只是预防措施
The missile was just a precaution.

482
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,610
你不能怪我们  旺达
You can hardly blame us, Wanda.

483
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:37,450
我想我能
Oh, I think I can.

484
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:41,280
我只警告你们这一次
This will be your only warning.

485
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:44,430
别靠近我家
Stay out of my home.

486
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:48,500
你们不惹我  我就不会惹你们
You don't bother me. I won't bother you.

487
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,240
要是这么简单就好了
I wish it could be that simple.

488
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:53,350
你劫持了整个镇的人
You've taken an entire town hostage.

489
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:56,060
拿着枪的人可不是我  局长
Well, I'm not the one with the guns, Director.

490
00:24:56,350 --> 00:24:58,610
但是你在掌控一切
But you are the one in control.

491
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,430
你还在这里
You're still here.

492
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:09,740
旺达  我不知道无人机上有武器
Wanda, I didn't know the drones were armed.

493
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,940
但你知道  对吗
But you know that, don't you?

494
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:14,730
一个全是平民的镇
A town full of civilians.

495
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:16,300
你这个心灵感应者
And you, a telepath,

496
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,710
却把一名天剑局探员带到你家
brought a S.W.O.R.D. Agent into your home.

497
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:22,200
你信任我帮你接生孩子
You trusted me to help deliver your babies.

498
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,020
在某种程度上  旺达  你知道我是盟友
On some level, Wanda, you know I am an ally.

499
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,980
我想帮你
I wanna help you.

500
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:31,860
怎么帮  你能给我什么
How? What could you possibly have to offer me?

501
00:25:33,230 --> 00:25:34,450
你想要什么
What do you want?

502
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,070
我已经拥有我想要的
I have what I want

503
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:43,040
没人能再次从我手上夺走
and no one will ever take it from me again.

504
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,380
别开枪
Stand down!

505
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:57,220
-旺达  -别开枪
- Wanda! - Stand down!

506
00:26:24,090 --> 00:26:25,370
你已经弄得一团糟
You've got a mess,

507
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:28,130
却还在用二流产品
and you're still using the next leading brand.

508
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,860
你需要拉各斯牌纸巾
You need Lagos brand paper towels.

509
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:34,250
{\an8}拉各斯牌  知名品牌

510
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:34,490
市面上吸水性最好的纸巾
The most absorbent paper towel available.

511
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,540
丈夫们也可以用哦
Husbands can use it too, you know.

512
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:47,510
拉各斯  清理意外残局的好帮手
Lagos. For when you make a mess you didn't mean to.

513
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:47,980
{\an8}拉各斯

514
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:52,180
火花  出来啊
Sparky! Come on, boy!

515
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,720
火花  火花
Sparky! Sparky!

516
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,090
这里  火花
Here, boy! Sparky!

517
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,760
小家伙们  出什么事了
Hey, what's the trouble, little dudes?

518
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,800
-我们找不到我们家的狗狗了  -别担心
- We can't find our dog. - Ah, don't worry.

519
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,900
它一定会出现的
He's sure to turn up.

520
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:04,370
你们妈妈不会让它走远的  女士再见
Your mom won't let him get far. Ma'am.

521
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,840
我不知道它会跑去哪
I don't know where he could've gone.

522
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,010
小家伙
Here, boy!

523
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,260
-火花  火花  -火花
- Sparky! Sparky! - Sparky!

524
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,320
火花
Sparky!

525
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,280
我...
I...

526
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:25,230
我本想把它包好了再来找你们的
I didn't wanna come until I'd wrapped him up.

527
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:27,600
它怎么了
What happened to him?

528
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,710
我在我家的杜鹃花丛里找到的它
Found him in my azalea bushes.

529
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,490
不知道它吃了多少叶子
Don't know how many leaves he ate.

530
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,210
我找到它时已经太迟了
I didn't find him until it was too late.

531
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,160
汤米  比利  我很遗憾
Tommy, Billy, I'm so sorry.

532
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,360
等等  别  别这么做
Wait. Don't. Don't.

533
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,730
-别做什么  -别让自己长大
- Don't what? - Don't age yourselves up.

534
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:52,270
逃避这情绪的冲动是很强烈
The urge to run from this feeling is powerful.

535
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,760
我知道
I know.

536
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,250
太难受了
It's too sad.

537
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,480
你可以改变一切  妈妈  改变死亡吧
You can fix anything, Mom. Fix the dead.

538
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,270
什么
What?

539
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,820
不行
No.

540
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,530
你能改变死亡吗
You can do that?

541
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,860
我想要告诉你们的是
I am trying to tell you

542
00:28:18,670 --> 00:28:21,960
生命是有其规则的  好吗
that there are rules in life, okay?

543
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:26,750
我们不能因为方便就急着长大
We can't rush aging just because it's convenient.

544
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:32,230
而且我们也不可以逆转死亡
And we can't reverse death.

545
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:34,970
不管死亡让我们多么悲痛
No matter how sad it makes us.

546
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,250
知道吗  有些事是永恒的
Okay? Some things are forever.

547
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,590
你说过家人是永恒的
You said family is forever.

548
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:43,010
它也是家人
He is family.

549
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,780
让它活过来  妈妈
Bring him back, Mom.

550
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:47,010
让谁活过来
Bring who back?

551
00:28:57,930 --> 00:29:01,070
孩子们  过来
Oh, boys. Come here.

552
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,680
孩子们怎么样
How are the boys?

553
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,140
有些伤心  不过他们会没事的
A little heartbroken, but they'll be all right.

554
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,040
这种事毕竟不常见
Well, it's not often

555
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,080
在一天之内得到一只狗  又埋葬了它
you get a dog and bury them the same day.

556
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:39,170
在郊外  生命的更替节奏很快
Well, life moves pretty fast out in the suburbs.

557
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,990
我和诺曼聊过了
I spoke with Norm.

558
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,650
我发现了他被压制的人格
I unearthed the man's suppressed personality

559
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:52,060
我和他谈话时没在你的监管之下
and I spoke to him free of your oversight.

560
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,950
旺达  他很痛苦
He was in pain, Wanda.

561
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,180
幻视
Vision...

562
00:29:58,710 --> 00:30:00,940
-听我说  我们能不能就...  -什么
- Listen, can we just... - What?

563
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:03,030
看电视去
Watch TV?

564
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:04,880
赶紧上床睡觉
Turn in for the night so

565
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,980
这样你就能再次改变一切吗
that you can change everything over again?

566
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,330
不行  旺达
No, Wanda.

567
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:13,170
你不能像控制别人那样控制我
You can't control me the way you do them.

568
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,740
是吗
Can't I?

569
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,710
我要去睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

570
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:24,010
不行  我们还没有说完
No! We're not done here.

571
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
什么是"马克西莫夫异象"
What is the "Maximoff Anomaly"?

572
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,760
什么
The what?

573
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,130
我只能相信这一切  不管这到底怎么回事
I have to believe that this, whatever this is,

574
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,660
一开始只是潜意识
was subconscious at first

575
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:36,340
而你最近才意识到
and that you only recently became aware of it.

576
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:39,010
意识到什么
Aware of what?

577
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:40,900
诺曼是有家庭的  旺达
Norm has a family, Wanda!

578
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:42,840
他有家人  而他现在没法见到他们
He has a family, and he can't reach them

579
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,810
是因为你不让他回家
because you won't let him reach them!

580
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,540
我不明白你到底在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about!

581
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,570
别再骗我了
Stop lying to me!

582
00:30:48,590 --> 00:30:54,380
这所有的一切  都是为了我们
This, all of this is for us.

583
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,800
所以让我来处理吧
So let me handle it.

584
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,170
西景外面是什么
What is outside of Westview?

585
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,100
你不会想知道的  我向你保证
You don't wanna know, I promise you.

586
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,540
你不能替我做决定  旺达
You don't get to make that choice for me, Wanda!

587
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,350
你以前从不会这样和我说话的
You've never talked to me like this before.

588
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,230
什么以前  以前什么时候
Before what? Before what?

589
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:14,460
我完全想不起来到西景前的日子
I can't remember my life before Westview.

590
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,970
我不知道我是谁
I don't know who I am!

591
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:17,560
我很害怕
I'm scared!

592
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:23,050
你是我的丈夫
You are my husband.

593
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:27,260
你是汤米和比利的父亲
You are Tommy and Billy's father.

594
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,990
这不就够了吗
Isn't that enough?

595
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,910
旺达  为什么西景镇没有别的孩子
Wanda, why are there no other children in Westview?

596
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:37,960
天啊  当然有  你别说了
Oh, God! There are! Just stop it!

597
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,900
不  不对
No. No.

598
00:31:39,850 --> 00:31:43,240
我每天早上上班时  游乐场一直是空的
The playground stands empty every morning I walk to work.

599
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,110
为什么  告诉我为什么
Why? Tell me why?

600
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:47,670
你真的觉得是我控制了一切吗
Do you really think that I am controlling everything?

601
00:31:48,610 --> 00:31:52,290
你觉得是我用某种办法管理着西景的所有人
That I am somehow in charge of everybody in Westview?

602
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,130
我遛着他们的狗  修剪着他们的草坪
I'm walking their dogs, mowing their lawns,

603
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:56,160
按时送他们去看牙医吗
getting them to dentist appointments on time?

604
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,620
我是说  我
I mean, I...

605
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:04,780
我不知道这一切都是怎么开始的
I don't know how any of this started in the first place.

606
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:10,000
旺达  你做的这些  是错误的
Wanda, what you're doing here, it's wrong.

607
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,730
-我  -这是错的
- I... - It is wrong.

608
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,940
这不是我做的
I didn't do that.

609
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:22,500
我
I...

610
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,260
你不相信我
You don't believe me.

611
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,470
旺达  我想相信你  但现在
Wanda, I want to, but at this point,

612
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:32,220
我要完全无视这些事实才能相信你
I'm ignoring statistics entirely.

613
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,010
旺达  这位是谁
Wanda, who is this?

614
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:23,860
一位消失很久的哥哥

615
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:26,210
来给他的臭妹妹一个紧紧的拥抱了

616
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,640
她给皮特重新选角了
She recast Pietro?

617
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,570
皮特
Pietro?

618
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,140
这根冰棍是谁
Who's the popsicle?

619
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:56,520
{\an8}请稍后

620
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,000
